# Fish Barrel

This plugin adds an overlay for the [Fish barrel](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fish_barrel) which displays the
number of raw fish stored inside.

## Limitations

- Picking raw fish from the ground straight into an open barrel is not yet supported.
- Performing a `Check` on the barrel to determine its content will only work if the outcome fits on a single screen.
