# Life-Saving Jewellery

This plugin displays infoboxes and sends destroy notifications for [Phoenix necklace](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Phoenix_necklace)
and [Ring of life](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ring_of_life), so you don't forget to equip them or replace them
once they're gone.
