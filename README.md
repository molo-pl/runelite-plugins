# Fish Barrel

This plugin adds an overlay for the [fish barrel](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fish_barrel) which displays the
number of raw fish stored inside.

## Limitations

- Currently, the plugin only works with an open barrel when the player is fishing.
  Manually filling the barrel or picking up fish from the ground is not yet supported.
- The plugin will start counting fish either once the barrel is emptied at a bank,
  or once it is filled to its capacity during fishing.
